Three colours have been placed in a secret order. Make your initial guess of the order by placing "R" for red, "B" for blue or "J" for yellow in the first, second and third text box. Then, a message will appear indicating how many colours were guess correctly and how many were in the correct order. This is a clue for your next guess. Keep guessing until the message confirms that you guessed three correct colours and all three are in the correct order.
